      Uses svg to make a canvas that can be interacted with. Clicking on the
      canvas creates a yellow circle. The move button animates these dots and
      cause them to bounces around. Further clicks increases the speed. There
      is no option to stop. There is an option to clear, which kills the circles.
      when it crosses an invisble vertical line the circle is split into two.
      Double clicking turns the circle blue.
